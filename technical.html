			parses them, and displays the results. There is more to it than
			this, mostly because I structured the code so that it is
			modular and can easily be extended, using MVC and similar
			patterns. Of course this complicates the details, but the
			overall idea is the same.</p><div class="refsect2" title="Test Results"><a name="id2866432"></a><h3>Test Results</h3><p> Test Results is now structured using the Composite Pattern.
				Parsing code hasn't changed, and I don't think the parsing
				code will ever deal with the more abstract/generic info.
				But the ui code is now more generalized, thus allowing it
				to handle changes that may occur in Test Results in the future
				without having to change. Ui code just takes an abstract
				object, and asks for its data and children. It then parses/
				displays the data and recurses on the children.
			</p><p> The net result is that Ui code does not make any assumptions
				about the type of object and thus more Test Result classes can
				be added later without breaking Ui code.

			inlined in the code. Its more for developers than
			end users. I setup doxygen to use
			<a class="ulink" href="http://code.foosel.org/doxypy" target="_top">doxypy</a>
			according to instructions I found
			<a class="ulink" href="http://www.joshuascotton.com/main/archives/80" target="_top">
			here</a> and
			<a class="ulink" href="http://www.joshuascotton.com/main/archives/64" target="_top">
			here</a>.
		</p><p> The docbook is more to end-users, but still contains
			information for developers. This file is built from
			said docbook.
		</p><p> A script was provided in order to build the documentation
			and is aptly named: <span class="command"><strong>build_documentation.sh</strong></span>.
			While this script can be invoked directly, it is mainly for
			use by setup.py. Setup.py has been customized so that when
			sdist is invoked, it will call <span class="command"><strong>build_documentation.sh
			</strong></span> and thus build all the documentation prior to packaging.
			As of June 10, 2010, all of the documentation is entirely rebuilt
			on each sdist invocation. Although I plan on designing it (probably
			through make or similar) so that it will only rebuild necessary
			files. At least if it gets to the point where it wastes too much
			time.

			 it. This way anyone, including users, can run them on their
			 machine. To run all of the tests, run test_runner.py.
		</p><p> Possible reasons for a test to fail even though the code
			is fine:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><h4><a name="id2858701"></a>Data files</h4><p>One of the data files used in testing (e.g: 
					Boost_Test, xml) is missing or cannot be accessed.
					If its missing, its probably b/c we accidentally
					forgot to package it up with everything else. The
					latter, can happen and isn't really worth fixing.
					For instance, Boost_Test cannot be accessed when
					the application has been installed in a virtualenv.
					I haven't tried yet, but its also possible/likely
					that the same is true for a normal installation.
