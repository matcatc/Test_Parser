			parses them, and displays the results. There is more to it than
			this, mostly because I structured the code so that it is
			modular and can easily be extended.
			Of course this complicates the details, but the
			overall idea is the same.

				Parsing code hasn't changed, and I don't think the parsing
				code will ever deal with the more abstract/generic info.
				But the UI code is now more generalized, thus allowing it
				to handle changes that may occur in Test Results in the future
				without having to change. UI code just takes an abstract
				object, and asks for its data and children. It then parses/
				displays the data and recurses on the children.
			</p><p> The net result is that UI code does not make any assumptions
				about the type of object and thus more Test Result classes can
				be added later without breaking UI code.
			</p><p> See TestResults.dia for more information.

				inlined in the code. Its more for developers than
				end users. I setup doxygen to use
				<a class="ulink" href="http://code.foosel.org/doxypy" target="_top">doxypy</a>
				according to instructions I found
				<a class="ulink" href="http://www.joshuascotton.com/main/archives/80" target="_top">
				here</a> and
				<a class="ulink" href="http://www.joshuascotton.com/main/archives/64" target="_top">
				here</a>.
			</p><p> The docbook is more for end-users, but still contains
				information for developers. This file is built from docbook.
			</p><p> A script was provided in order to build the documentation
				and is aptly named: <span class="command"><strong>build_documentation.sh</strong></span>.
				While this script can be invoked directly, it is also used
				by setup.py. Setup.py has been customized so that when
				sdist is invoked, it will call <span class="command"><strong>build_documentation.sh
				</strong></span> and thus build all the documentation prior to packaging.
				As of June 10, 2010, all of the documentation is entirely rebuilt
				on each sdist invocation. Although I plan on designing it (probably
				through make or similar) so that it will only rebuild necessary
				files. At least if it gets to the point where it wastes too much
				time.
			</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p><span class="command"><strong>build_documentation.sh</strong></span> needs to be
				run from the directory in which it is located.
				</p></div><p> Also included in the doc directory are UML diagrams and other
				miscellaneous and likely outdated documents.
			</p></div><div class="section" title="Tests"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2910404"></a>Tests</h3></div></div></div><p> The tests used to test Test Parser are packaged along with
				 it. This way anyone, including users, can run them on their
				 machine. To run all of the tests, run
				 <span class="command"><strong>test_runner.py</strong></span>.
			</p><p> Possible reasons for a test to fail even though the code
				is fine:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><h4><a name="id2907937"></a>Data files</h4><p>One of the data files used in testing (e.g: 
						Boost_Test, xml) is missing or cannot be accessed.
						If its missing, its probably b/c we accidentally
						forgot to package it up with everything else. The
						latter, can happen and isn't really worth fixing.
						For instance, Boost_Test cannot be accessed when
						the application has been installed in a virtualenv.
						I haven't tried yet, but its also possible/likely
						that the same is true for a normal installation.
