. Error message for failing to import tkinter wrong
+
--
Suggests installing `python-tk`, but this is a python3 program. So it should
instead suggest installing `python3-tk`.
--


. Switch to pyside?
+
--
Switch from PyQt4 to pyside?
--


. Update documentation
+
--
Documentation needs to be overhauled altogether.

Returning to the project for the first time in 2 years, it was unclear to me
exactly how to use it and where to get started. I had to dig through some code
to figure out how to get it to work (what was going wrong). It should be much
easier for an user to pick it up and get going.

.. Make it easier to get started with.
.. Switch to more maintainable document type (asciidoc).
.. Clean up info regarding installation instructions.
--


. Program help should be more informative (helpful)
+
--
Returning to the project for the first time in 2 years, it was unclear exactly
how to use it.

. Mention that some test runners may need to take into account current working directory
+
--
Some test runners may assume that they're being run from the directory they're
in. But there's no gaurantee that an user will run this program from the same
directory as the test runner is located. So they should handle this edge case.

. Example where this issue occurs
============
    loader = unittest.TestLoader()
    suite = loader.discover('./tests/')
============

The above example is from another project of mine, where I was using python's
unittest module to automatically find (discover) and run all of my tests. The
discovery step is shown above, and as you can see, specifies the current path
as relative to the test runner script. Except that its actually a path relative
to the current working directory, and so broke when run by Test Parser.

. Fixed example
============
    dir_name = os.path.dirname(__file__)
    test_dir = os.path.join(dir_name, 'tests')

    loader = unittest.TestLoader()
    suite = loader.discover(test_dir)
============

The above solution worked, although I'd be careful to make sure that __file__
works in all situations. Its not clear if it breaks under some circumstances
(e.g: py2exe).

. Change program name
+
--
After 2 years of not working on it, I still feel the name should be changed to TeVi.
